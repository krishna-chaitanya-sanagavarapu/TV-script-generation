# TV-script-generation
Udacity's TV Script Generator project implementation with PyTorch

**Udacity's original repo is [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation)**


## Project Overview

This project generates our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. Used part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network built will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
